I have been living in Norway :norway: sine 2013. My mother tongue is Chinese :cn:, and I speak better Norwegian than English.

Technological innovation, environment, marketing and programming are the fields I am interested in. ❤️

Any successful project, be it big or small, has one thing at its core: effective collaboration, and you can achieve it with knowledge sharing.

- Getting more ambitious things done.
- Taking the long-term view.
- Empowering great team and **PIPRO** to flourish.
